      <h1>GUB -- Grand Unified Builder -- HISTORY</h1>

      <h2>HISTORY</h2>

      The story starts June 1999 with a
      <a href="http://web.ncf.ca/bf250/index.html">crazy guy</a>
      with an itch to
      <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20020121033345/http://www.sankey.ws/gnunt.html">run LilyPond on Windows</a>.
      To get
      <a href="http://web.ncf.ca/bf250/rpm.html">a feel</a>
      for the times, this was
      <a href="http://lilypond.org/downloads/source/v1.1/">LilyPond-1.1.47</a>,
      requiring Egcs 1.1, Python 1.5, Guile 1.3, discussing on
      help-gnu-music@gnu.org.

      Two years later
      <a href="http://lilypond.org/~janneke/software/cygwin-cross">Cygwin
	cross</a>, our first cross build environment is released.

      <p>
	This is evolved into
	a <a href="http://sourceware.org/ml/cygwin-apps/2002-07/msg00572.html">patch
	  set for mknetrel</a>.  Spring 2005: In a bold move a
	<a href="http://cvs.savannah.gnu.org/viewvc/lilypond/installers/windows">set
	  of patches for MinGW</a> are created to build LilyPond and all its
	[17] dependencies.
	<!--
	   expat fontconfig freetype gettext ghostscript glib gmp guile
	   jpeg libiconv libpng libtool lilypad lilypond mingw pango python
	   regex zlib
	   !-->
	Simultaniously, a cross build environment and installer for
	<a href="http://cvs.savannah.gnu.org/viewvc/lilypond/installers/macos/">MacOSX</a>
	is created.
      </p>

      <p>
	Creating a cross build environment is not too difficult, esp. not if
	you know how to use Google.  The problem is that they always break
	and never work on other machines.  GUB starts as an effort to unify
	the Windows and MacOS builders and to make the process somewhat
	dependable and reproducible, i.e.: even more free time for the
	developers (if there is such a thing) as the builds always succeed.
	It uses Python instead of make and bash and adds checksums for the
	package build specs.  The unification of cross builds greatly
	facilitates adding of new architectures and before long GUB
	supports cross building lilypond binaries for 9 different platforms.
      </p>

      <p>
	GUB2 adds serialization of the Python build code before execution.
	This makes the build checksumming less coarse, ie, less gratuitous
	rebuilds and more reliable.  Also, all Python code is executed
	before the build process starts, which means that there is less
	chance of silly run time errors.  Lots of packages are added in an
	effort to replace the OpenEmbedded-based build system for the Samco
	3G video phone at SES, Philips Research Eindhoven.
      </p>

      <p>
	In <a href="http://news.opensuse.org/2008/08/07/announcing-hack-week-iii">Novell's
	  Hackweek-iii</a> GUB enters into its Third Life with
	<a href="http://lilypond.org/gub">GUB3</a>, adding cross-platform
	build dependencies and patches for an <a href="oo.o">OpenOffice.org
	  MinGW cross build</a>, including all essential libraries.  Later,
	<a href="inkscape">Inkscape</a> is added, exploring and
	implementing x.org dependencies.  After that, building a
	windows installer for <a href="denemo">GNU Denemo</a>
	took only one day, including all dependencies.
